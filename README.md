# wallet-tracker-Solana
I have developed a bot written in TypeScript that continuously analyzes active traders on the platform pump.fun. The bot is designed to identify wallets that exhibit a high Profit and Loss (PNL) ratio combined with low drawdown, which are indicators typically associated with insider wallets. By monitoring these key metrics, the bot can efficiently flag wallets that may be using privileged information to achieve consistently high returns with minimal risk.
